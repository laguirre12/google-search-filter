-extension that excludes certain websites/domains from search results
  - Many results of a google search may be irrelevant and people may wish
    to exclude a domain entirely based on personal preference. (ex: exclude
    all facebook results). A user can create a list of domains that they want
    to exclude from search results (upto a specified time interval) and edit
    this list (add, remove, clear, etc.) After conducting a normal google
    search, results from domains in the list will be filtered, and users may
    have the option to view filtered results.
  - Target Audience:

  - On the options page there is a list of domains/hosts that will be
  filtered from search results.
